# Security Model & Threat Analysis

This document outlines the security model for Fund-My-Cause, including threat analysis, mitigation strategies, security checklists, and incident response procedures.

---

## 1. Security Model

### 1.1 Core Principles

Fund-My-Cause is built on three core security principles:

1. **Immutability**: Smart contracts deployed on Stellar are immutable. Once deployed, contract logic cannot be changed, ensuring predictable behavior and preventing backdoors.
2. **Pull-based Refunds**: Contributors claim refunds individually, preventing a single point of failure where a creator could block all refunds.
3. **On-chain Verification**: All critical operations (contributions, withdrawals, refunds) are enforced by the smart contract, not the frontend.

### 1.2 Trust Boundaries

│  │  - Private key management                            │   │
│  │  - Transaction signing                               │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key assumption**: The Stellar network and Soroban runtime are secure. Vulnerabilities in Stellar/Soroban core are out of scope and should be reported to [Stellar's bug bounty program](https://www.stellar.org/bug-bounty-program).

### 1.3 Threat Model Scope

**In Scope:**
- Smart contract logic (crowdfund, registry)
- Frontend application (Next.js interface)
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes
- Wallet integration and transaction signing
- Data validation and input sanitization

**Out of Scope:**
- Stellar/Soroban core protocol vulnerabilities
- Network-level attacks (DDoS on Stellar infrastructure)
- User device compromise (malware, keyloggers)
- Social engineering attacks targeting end users

## 2. Threat Analysis

### 2.1 Smart Contract Threats

#### Threat: Reentrancy Attacks
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: A malicious contract could call back into the crowdfund contract during execution, potentially manipulating state.  
**Mitigation**:
- Soroban's contract model does not support traditional reentrancy due to its synchronous execution model.
- State changes are atomic within a single transaction.
- No external calls are made during state mutations.

#### Threat: Integer Overflow/Underflow
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Arithmetic operations on token amounts could overflow, causing incorrect fund calculations.  
**Mitigation**:
- Rust's type system prevents overflow in debug mode and panics in release mode.
- All arithmetic uses checked operations (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`).
- Comprehensive unit tests verify edge cases (zero amounts, max values).

#### Threat: Unauthorized Fund Withdrawal
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: A non-creator could withdraw funds from a successful campaign.  
**Mitigation**:
- The `withdraw` function checks `msg.sender() == creator` before allowing withdrawal.
- Only the creator can call `withdraw`.
- Funds are transferred directly to the creator's address via Stellar's native token operations.

#### Threat: Incorrect Refund Calculation
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Contributors could receive incorrect refund amounts due to calculation errors.  
**Mitigation**:
- Refund amount is stored per contributor at contribution time.
- `refund_single` returns exactly the amount contributed, with no deductions.
- Refunds are only available if the campaign goal is not met.

#### Threat: Deadline Manipulation
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: An attacker could manipulate the campaign deadline to extend or shorten the contribution window.  
**Mitigation**:
- Deadline is set at initialization and stored immutably.
- Deadline cannot be changed after initialization.
- Deadline is checked against Stellar's ledger timestamp, which is consensus-verified.

#### Threat: Platform Fee Theft
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Platform fees could be redirected to an attacker's address.  
**Mitigation**:
- Platform address and fee percentage are set at initialization and immutable.
- Fees are calculated and transferred only during `withdraw`.
- Fee calculation uses integer division to prevent rounding exploits.

### 2.2 Frontend Threats

#### Threat: Phishing via Malicious Domain
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: An attacker could host a fake Fund-My-Cause interface to steal wallet credentials.  
**Mitigation**:
- Users should only access the official domain announced in the GitHub README.
- HTTPS is enforced; HTTP connections are rejected.
- Users should bookmark the official URL and never click links from unsolicited messages.
- See [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md) for verification steps.

#### Threat: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Malicious JavaScript could be injected into the frontend to steal wallet data or sign unauthorized transactions.  
**Mitigation**:
- Next.js automatically escapes JSX content.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers restrict script execution.
- User input is sanitized before display.
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used without sanitization.
- Regular dependency audits via `npm audit` and GitHub Dependabot.

#### Threat: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: An attacker could trick a user into signing a transaction on behalf of a malicious site.  
**Mitigation**:
- Wallet connections are explicit and require user approval.
- Transactions are constructed by the frontend and signed by the user's wallet.
- The wallet displays full transaction details before signing.
- No automatic transaction signing occurs.

#### Threat: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: An attacker on the network could intercept and modify RPC calls or responses.  
**Mitigation**:
- All communication uses HTTPS with TLS 1.2+.
- RPC endpoints are verified via DNS and certificate pinning (where applicable).
- Users should verify contract addresses on Stellar Expert before contributing.

#### Threat: Malicious Contract Address Injection
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: The frontend could be compromised to display a different contract address, tricking users into interacting with a malicious contract.  
**Mitigation**:
- Contract addresses are stored in environment variables and verified at build time.
- Contract addresses are displayed prominently in the UI.
- Users should verify the contract address on Stellar Expert before contributing.
- The contract address is immutable once deployed.

### 2.3 Wallet Integration Threats

#### Threat: Wallet Extension Compromise
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: A malicious browser extension could intercept wallet operations or steal private keys.  
**Mitigation**:
- Users should install Freighter only from official sources (freighter.app or official browser stores).
- Users should review extension permissions and keep extensions updated.
- Hardware wallet support (Ledger) provides an additional layer of security.
- See [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md) for wallet security guidance.

#### Threat: Unauthorized Transaction Signing
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: A compromised frontend could request the wallet to sign a malicious transaction.  
**Mitigation**:
- Wallets display full transaction details before signing.
- Users must explicitly approve each transaction.
- The wallet verifies the contract ID and operation type.
- Users should review every transaction before signing.

### 2.4 Deployment & Infrastructure Threats

#### Threat: Compromised CI/CD Pipeline
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: An attacker could compromise GitHub Actions to deploy malicious code or contracts.  
**Mitigation**:
- GitHub Actions workflows are version-pinned and reviewed.
- Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets and never logged.
- Deployment workflows require manual approval for production.
- All deployments are audited and logged.

#### Threat: Unauthorized Contract Deployment
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: An attacker could deploy a malicious contract under the Fund-My-Cause name.  
**Mitigation**:
- Only authorized team members can deploy contracts.
- Deployments require GitHub Actions approval.
- Deployed contract IDs are published in release notes.
- Users should verify contract IDs on Stellar Expert.

#### Threat: Dependency Vulnerability
**Severity**: Medium to High  
**Description**: A compromised or vulnerable dependency could introduce security flaws.  
**Mitigation**:
- Dependencies are pinned to exact versions in `Cargo.lock` and `package-lock.json`.
- `npm audit` and `cargo audit` are run in CI/CD.
- Dependabot automatically creates PRs for security updates.
- Dependencies are reviewed before merging.

### 2.5 Data & Privacy Threats

#### Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Private keys, API keys, or other secrets could be exposed in logs or version control.  
**Mitigation**:
- Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets, not in code.
- `.env` files are in `.gitignore`.
- Logs are sanitized to remove sensitive data.
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental secret commits.

#### Threat: Unauthorized Data Access
**Severity**: Low to Medium  
**Description**: An attacker could access campaign data or contributor information.  
**Mitigation**:
- All campaign data is public on-chain (by design).
- Contributor addresses are public (Stellar addresses are public).
- No private user data is stored off-chain.
- No authentication is required to view campaigns (intentional).
